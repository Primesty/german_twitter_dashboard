# German Twitter Dashboard

## Data

The data come from Twitter (via the API) and from *N* = 62 participants, who submitted online questionnaires through Qualtrics 
with their demographic information and their Big Five personality assessment.

### Dashboard development

The development of the dashboard was informed by feedback from people along the way to make it more user friendly (UX). 
My main motivation was to make some of the data from my dissertation accessible and multimodal.
